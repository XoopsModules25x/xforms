This is a merged version of xForms and eForms.

xForms was developed by Dylian Melgert (http://www.dylian.eu/) and based on Liaise module by Brandycoke Productions (http://www.brandycoke.com)

eForms was a fork of xForms developed by Juan Garc√©s (http://www.educacioninformatica.com/).

Since it seems like eForms was not further developed, the XOOPS Team has merged the code back into xForms.
