TODO:
=================================
- add sanitation to many of the form input values
- create checkbox for number input in Admin to include/exclude default/step
- add Modernizer to module to check browser capabilities and improve 'fallback' input methods for:
  - range
  - time (for Firefox - use http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/)
- create renderValidationJS or use pattern for HTML5 types since many browsers don't actually validate data

ENHANCEMENTS TO BE ADDED:
=================================
- create/test xBootstrap templates
- Add option to date element to set 'Today' as the min/max/default date where 'Today' is dynamically calculated to   set minimum as 'Today' (not 'Current Date' which is fixed at time form is created).
- In admin - allow selecting multiple 'default' values in select boxes (select, country, etc) if select box is set to 'allow multiple selections'.
- add Elements:
  - rating | use https://github.com/antennaio/jquery-bar-rating
  - payment use xPayment plugin to create payment element
- add Xmf\Metagen support to dynamically create meta data for front side pages/forms

KNOWN BUGS:
=================================
- javascript 'fallback' methods don't work in form block (javascript not loaded in block)
